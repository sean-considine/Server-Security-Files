# Apache/PHP Security Files
.ini and .conf files to add some additional security to the PHP and Apache configurations. Recommendations taken from both [OWASP](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/) and [Security Headers](https://securityheaders.com/).
## Usage
Depending on your server setup, you can copy/paste the contents of the security.ini file into your php.ini file and copy/paste the contents of the security.conf file into your httpd.conf file.

Alternatively if you have **Additional Configuration Files** set up then you can just add the files to the correct directories.
